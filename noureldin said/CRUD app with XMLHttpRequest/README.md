📘 Simple CRUD App Using XMLHttpRequest + JSONPlaceholder

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using XMLHttpRequest and the JSONPlaceholder API.

It shows how to:

✔ Load a list of posts (GET)

✔ Add a new post (POST)

✔ Update an existing post (PUT)

✔ Delete a post (DELETE)

No backend is required — everything works using a free fake REST API.
